In the context of genomics, the founder effect is the reduction of the variability of genomes in a given population due to separation from the original population. For example, suppose there is a population confined to some geographical area for a long time. The population’s genome will experience constant mutations which accumulate over time. This will result in high variability in the population’s genome. Now suppose a small off-shoot group is separated from the original population. This off-shoot group will only carry a subset of the original genome. The new group will have a reduced genomic variability and its offspring will carry genotypes and traits of the original off-shoot group. This type of reduction in the genomic variability is called the Founder Effect. For example, humans stayed longer within Africa than they did outside. This is reflected in the fact that Africa has the highest genomic variability in human populations.

I am no expert in such topics; however, I was thinking whether there is a similar effect pertaining to the evolution of languages. How do languages spoken by groups of people within a geographical area with limited outside contact compare to those languages that managed to break-off as dialects? Is there something similar to the Founder effect going on? Do we get a reduction in variability in things like the corpus, phonemes, syntax, etc.; as we moved away from the `epicenter’ of the original language? I do not expect there to be a one-to-one correspondence between the genetic story and the linguistic one. The latter is highly susceptible to both fast and big changes thanks to information transfer through trade, politics and literature; to name a few. See this article to read about the similarities and differences between biological and linguistic evolution.

An analysis of phonemic diversity has been carried out in [(Atkinson 2011)]((https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1199295)). Atkinson demonstrates that similarly to the genomic case, the phonemic inventory of languages decrees with distance from Africa. Languages with the smallest phonemic inventory being in South America and Oceania. A simulation study by Fort and Peréz-Losada shows a similar linear decrease in phonemes with distance travelled from Africa [(Peréz-Losada 2016)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2016.0185).
