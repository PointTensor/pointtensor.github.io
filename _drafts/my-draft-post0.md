In his [paper](https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/alusur/article/view/6781), Dr Marijn van Putten shows and argues that there was a distinction between the letters jīm and Ḥāʾ/Khāʾ in their final form in early Quranic manuscripts. This is important since in early manuscripts, these letters lacked the dots which helped distinguish between them. For example, jīm and Ḥāʾ/Khāʾ are written as ج, ح, خ respectively (from right to left). The jīm has a dot in the middle of the letter, while the Ḥāʾ lacks a dot. Moreover, Dr Van Putten argues that this distinction stems from an earlier period of the arabic script which originates from the Nabataean Aramaic script, in which the three letters had distinct shapes. He also provides evidence that the merger between the initial and final jīm happened in the islamic period rather than the pre-islamic period. This is study is important because this finding could pave the way to further accurately estimate the age of certain manuscripts that seem to be close in time. For example manuscripts that use the straight jīm could be older than those that use the hooked one.

Van Putten examines several manuscripts that contain instances of jīm and  Ḥāʾ/Khāʾ. Let us briefly showcase some of his findings:

# 1. Codex Amrensis 1
This manuscript is dated to around the first half of the second/eighth century on paleographical grounds. The script is written in a style called Late Hijazi (as named by Cellard) with elements similar to Kufic A. In this manuscript, the straight shape is used for jīm while for  Ḥāʾ/Khāʾ the curved shape is used instead. As noted by Van Putten, the final jīm is used 24 times in its straight form.
