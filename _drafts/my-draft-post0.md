In his [paper](https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/alusur/article/view/6781), Dr Marijn van Putten shows and argues that there was a distinction between the letters jīm and Ḥāʾ/Khāʾ in their final form in early Quranic manuscripts. This is important since in early manuscripts, these letters lacked the dots which helped distinguish between them. For example, jīm and Ḥāʾ/Khāʾ are written as ج, ح, خ respectively (from right to left). The jīm has a dot in the middle of the letter, while the Ḥāʾ lacks a dot. Moreover, Dr Van Putten argues that this distinction stems from an earlier period of the arabic script which originates from the Nabataean Aramaic script, in which the three letters had distinct shapes. He also provides evidence that the merger between the initial and final jīm happened in the islamic period rather than the pre-islamic period. This is study is important because this finding could pave the way to further accurately estimate the age of certain manuscripts that seem to be close in time. For example manuscripts that use the straight jīm could be older than those that use the hooked one.

Van Putten examines several manuscripts that contain instances of jīm and  Ḥāʾ/Khāʾ. Let us briefly showcase some of his findings:

# 1. Codex Amrensis 1
This manuscript is dated to around the first half of the second/eighth century on paleographical grounds. The script is written in a style called Late Hijazi (as named by Cellard) with elements similar to Kufic A. In this manuscript, the straight shape is used for jīm while for  Ḥāʾ/Khāʾ the curved shape is used instead. As noted by Van Putten, the final jīm is used 24 times in its straight form.

On the other hand, the ḥa' appears written in the curved shape 39 times about of a total of 40 instances.

whereas the khā' appears once with a curve and once without.

Van Putten notes that the distribution between jīm and ḥa'/kha' has statistical significance and is not merely by chance. The p values he calculates is less that p = 0.0001, where p > 0.05 indicates a distribution arising from chance. Therefore, is it rather unlikely that the link between the shape and sing of the letters is coincidental.

# 2.  BnF Arabe 330g and CBL Is. 1615 II
This manuscript is written in an unclassified style, all be it with some features recognizable as Hijazi. George identifies it as an intermediate between Hijazi and Kufic. Van Putten notes that out of 12 instances of the letter jim, it is written 11 times in the straight shape and regardless of whether it is preceded by a connecting letter. The final ḥa'/kha' appear 34 times, each time with a curve. This manuscript shows that the sign of the jīm and ḥa'/kha' are distinctive. The Fisher's exact test p value is 0.0001.

And a single instance of curved jīm.

# 3. CBL Is. 1615 I, Doha Museum of Islamic Art Ms. 68, and a Folio from a Private Collection

This manuscripts shows a more even distribution between the usage of the straight and curved jīm (22 to 17 times, respectively). Here are some examples of the straight jīm

Q28:32 takhruj           |  Q30:19 yukhriju  |   Q30:19 yukhriju (5r, l. 12)

and some of the curved one

The straight ḥa' is found only 4 times out of 44 instances, while the kha' appears 7 times and only in the curved form. As noted above, this transcript shows a more even distribution of the shape of the letter jīm; perhaps, representing a translational stage between the manuscripts that keep the shapes distinct and those that fully shifted to the curved jīm. The p value at 0.0001 shows a statistical significance. Van Putten notes that the scribe of this manuscript seemed to have a choice regarding the shape of jīm.

# 4. BnF Arabe 330f

This is another manuscript in the KUFIC A.I style that, despite its limited attestations, shows a degree of variance between the straight and open jīm. The jīm may be curved, but the ḥa' is always curved.

There 6 instances of jīm in this manuscript, 4 are straight and two are curved,

while thee ḥa' appears 11 times and always with a hoo Here are some examples

Even though the amount of samples is limited in this manuscript, the p value of 0.0063 still shows statistical significance.

The above were just a very brief showcasing of the evidence that Van Putten provides and elaborates on. Interested reader should read the actual paper and scrutinise the references that he proves. There are some manuscripts from the early period that always have the curved jīm as he shows with the Codex Parisino-Petropolitanus (Hand C) manuscript. Let us now move on to the origin of such distinction and how it fits in the context of Paleography and the ancestor of the Arabic script, the Nabataean script.

# Nabataean origins
Van Putten notes that the distinction between the jīm and Ḥa'/Kha' is attested in many early manuscripts and in a variety of styles, but it is permanently lost in later manuscripts and styles. There are very early manuscripts which did not distinguish between he letters, and others that did; what are the possible origins of the distinction? Van Putten provides two possible explanations of which one of them is the correct one in his view. The first one is that there might have been a free variation between the letters, and the scribe could choose which shape to use and make a distinction between the letter. The second possibility is that this distinction is inherited from an earlier stage of the Arabic language. The first possibility is strengthened by the fact that there are other letters which have different forms, but exactly the same pronunciation, such as the final yā'. As an example, here are two photos of the word fī (فى)

Q9:110         |  Q9:111  |  
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
![fi-short]({{"/assets/images/quran-manuscripts/fi/fi-long.png" | absolute_url }})  |  ![fi-long]({{"assets/images/quran-manuscripts/fi/fi-short.png" | absolute_url }})    |

The shape seems to have no functionality is a mere stylistic choice. Therefore, one could suppose that it is the same case for ḥa' and its two form. However, Van Putten argues that there are problems problem with such a hypothesis. First, there are no explanation as to why some manuscripts used this free variation to make a distinction, while others did not. Second, all the examined manuscripts are dotted; therefore, ambiguities were not a concern when it came to the final from of jīm and ḥa'. Third, words involving final jīm and ḥa' that can be ambiguous, such as zawj and rūḥ (روح, زوج) are scarce. Thus there is not a clear incentive for using different form in order to distinguish between the letters. Finally, Van Putten states that the scribes did not see a reason to distinguish between the final yā' and the alif maqṣūrah, which seems like a sensible distinction in his view. With these point, Van Putten concludes that early scribes did not employ these variants in the shape opf the letters to make phonemic distinctions.
