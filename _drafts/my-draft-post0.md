In his [paper](https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/alusur/article/view/6781), Dr Marijn van Putten shows and argues that there was a distinction between the letters jīm and Ḥāʾ/Khāʾ in their final form in early Quranic manuscripts. This is important since in early manuscripts, these letters lacked the dots which helped distinguish between them. For example, jīm and Ḥāʾ/Khāʾ are written as ج, ح, خ respectively (from right to left). The jīm has a dot in the middle of the letter, while the Ḥāʾ lacks a dot. Moreover, Dr Van Putten argues that this distinction stems from an earlier period of the arabic script which originates from the Nabataean Aramaic script, in which the three letters had distinct shapes. He also provides evidence that the merger between the initial and final jīm happened in the islamic period rather than the pre-islamic period. This is study is important because this finding could pave the way to further accurately estimate the age of certain manuscripts that seem to be close in time. For example manuscripts that use the straight jīm could be older than those that use the hooked one.

Van Putten examines several manuscripts that contain instances of jīm and  Ḥāʾ/Khāʾ. Let us briefly showcase some of his findings:

# 1. Codex Amrensis 1
This manuscript is dated to around the first half of the second/eighth century on paleographical grounds. The script is written in a style called Late Hijazi (as named by Cellard) with elements similar to Kufic A. In this manuscript, the straight shape is used for jīm while for  Ḥāʾ/Khāʾ the curved shape is used instead. As noted by Van Putten, the final jīm is used 24 times in its straight form.

On the other hand, the ḥa' appears written in the curved shape 39 times about of a total of 40 instances.

whereas the khā' appears once with a curve and once without.

Van Putten notes that the distribution between jīm and ḥa'/kha' has statistical significance and is not merely by chance. The p values he calculates is less that p = 0.0001, where p > 0.05 indicates a distribution arising from chance. Therefore, is it rather unlikely that the link between the shape and sing of the letters is coincidental.

# 2.  BnF Arabe 330g and CBL Is. 1615 II
This manuscript is written in an unclassified style, all be it with some features recognizable as Hijazi. George identifies it as an intermediate between Hijazi and Kufic. Van Putten notes that out of 12 instances of the letter jim, it is written 11 times in the straight shape and regardless of whether it is preceded by a connecting letter. The final ḥa'/kha' appear 34 times, each time with a curve. This manuscript shows that the sign of the jīm and ḥa'/kha' are distinctive. The Fisher's exact test p value is 0.0001.

And a single instance of curved jīm.

Here are some examples of ḥa',

The kha' also has a curved shape in this manuscript

# 3. CBL Is. 1615 I, Doha Museum of Islamic Art Ms. 68, and a Folio from a Private Collection

This manuscripts shows a more even distribution between the usage of the straight and curved jīm (22 to 17 times, respectively).
