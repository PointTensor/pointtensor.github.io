I am theoretical physics PhD graduate who is interested in various topics ranging from the hard sciences to AI to history. I find that it is easier to consolidate new ideas that I come across by writing about them, either as articles or simple notes. Therefore I decided to start is blog in hope of sharing my interest with the rest of humanity.

You can also find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/SemiticSoul) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashid-alawadhi/).

Find my projects at my [github](github.com/PointTensor)
