I am theoretical physics PhD graduate who is interested in various topics ranging from the hard sciences to AI to history. I find that it is easier to consolidate new ideas that I come across by writing about them, either as articles or simple notes. Therefore I decided to start this blog in hope of sharing my interest with the rest of humanity.

You can also find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/SemiticSoul) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashid-alawadhi/).

Find my machine learning projects at my [github](https://github.com/ralawadhi) and my scientific publications in [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W4-SjWQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
